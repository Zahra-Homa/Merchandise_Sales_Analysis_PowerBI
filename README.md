# Merchandise_Sales_Analysis_PowerBI
This Power BI project explores merchandise sales data from a popular influencer. The project was created as a learning and portfolio exercise to practice Power BI.
The dashboard provides insights into sales trends, product performance, customer demographics, and the impact of international sales.

##  Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore and visualize merchandise sales data using Power BI in order to answer key business questions such as:
1.	What are the overall sales trends?
2.	Which product categories perform the best?
3.	What are the most and least popular products?
4.	How does location affect sales performance?
5.	What impact does international shipping have on sales?
6.	What is the demographic profile of buyers?
7.	How do ratings and reviews correlate with sales?
8.	What are the trends in shipping charges?

- Clothing is the best-performing product category.  
- Local sales generate more revenue, but international orders have a higher average order value (AOV).  
- The 18–29 age group is the strongest customer segment.  
- Sales performance varies significantly by location.  

##  Business Questions Answered
1.	What are the overall sales trends?
    Sales are mostly stable over the months with small ups and downs.
    There is a drop in the last month
2.	Which product categories perform the best?
    Clothing performs the best and generates the highest sales.
3.	What are the most and least popular products?
    The most popular products are Clothing items.
    The least popular products are items in the “Other” category.
4.	How does location affect sales performance?
    Sales vary by city.
    Some cities like San Francisco, New Jersey, New York, and Sacramento perform better than others.
    This shows that location has a strong impact on sales.
5.	What impact does international shipping have on sales?
    Local sales are higher than international sales.
    However, international customers have a higher average order value (AOV), meaning they spend more per order.
    So international sales are fewer, but more valuable per order.
6.	What is the demographic profile of buyers?
    The 18-29 age group buys the most, both locally and internationally.
    The 30-35 age group buys less compared to younger customers.
    So younger customers are the main buyers.
7.	How do ratings and reviews correlate with sales?
    The average rating is 3.5, which is medium.
    Sales still happen even with average ratings, so ratings do not strongly stop people from buying.
    Better ratings could help improve sales, but they are not the main driver.
8.	What are the trends in shipping charges?
    Shipping costs change slightly over time, but stay mostly stable.
    There is no strong upward or downward trend, so shipping costs are fairly consistent.
